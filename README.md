# EC2-Web-Hosting-Project
# Hosting an HTML Web Application on AWS EC2

In this project, I hosted a simple HTML web application using **AWS EC2**. The purpose was to learn cloud hosting, server management, and basic networking.

## What I Learned
- Setting up and configuring an EC2 instance on AWS.
- Understanding EC2 security (SSH keys, security groups).
- Mapping a domain to an EC2 instance.

## Project Steps
1. Set up an EC2 instance on AWS.
2. Install a web server (Apache).
3. Upload the HTML files to the EC2 instance.
4. Configure the domain and point it to the EC2 IP.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding SSL with Letâ€™s Encrypt for secure communication.
- Auto-scaling the web application.
- Setting up CloudWatch for server monitoring.
